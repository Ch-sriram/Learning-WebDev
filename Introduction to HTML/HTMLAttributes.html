		<h4>&lt;a> tag (Anchor tag) [Used for adding Hyperlinks]</h4>
		
		<!--<a> tag is an inline html element.-->
		<a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">Click here to open DuckDuckGo Search Engine</a>
		<!--The aforementioned href is a https path which needs internet connection.-->
		<br>
		<a href="www.duckduckgo.com">This won't do the same as the above Hyperlink as "https://" is mising from the href attribute of this Anchor tag. The browser assumes that this link is to be opened in ftp</a>

		<!--<a> tag can also be used to give href to other html files too. It is done as follows:-->
		<br>
