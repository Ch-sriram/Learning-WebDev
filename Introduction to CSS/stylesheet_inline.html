	<!-- 
		Inline styling was the first way to style the markup in the documents. This way of styling is tedious because of the following reasons:
		1. If we want to colour the entire group of <li> tag content with the red colour, we would have to apply the same code to each and 
		   and every <li> tag individually.
		   Example: 
		   		<li style="color: red;">Reading</li>
				<li style="color: red;">Cricket</li>
				<li style="color: red;">Partying</li>
		   This is just repetition of code, to colour all the list elements red.

		2. The CSS & HTML code are in the same file. This makes the code readability difficult.
